\title{sampleEntryNumbers function}
\usage{
sampleEntryNumbers(bsp, targetBudget, percentRanges, nAttempts = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{bsp}{A list of objects to combine with the species and population parameters. bsp is short for breeding sheme parameters}

\item{targetBudget}{Numeric value that you want the budget adjusted to}

\item{percentRanges}{Numeric matrix with nStages+1 rows and two columns. Columns are min and max percentage of budget. Rows are costs for crossing, genotyping, trialing each stage.}

\item{nAttempts}{Integer maximum number of attempts to sample percentages and have them follow the rules of stages becoming progressively smaller.}
}
\value{
A revised bsp with the sizes of the stages within the percentage ranges specified.
}
\description{
Specify a range of percentages that are allowable for the stages. Function will sample within those percentages and generate a consistent scheme to test. For the stage that gets genotyped, the budget is forced to be the sum of the genotyping + trialling costs.
}
\details{
Call this function after running specifyCosts.
}
\examples{
Assume stages of CET, PYT, UYT, so percentRanges needs 4 rows
Assume CET is genotyped so more budget there
percentRanges <- matrix(c(0.02, 0.24, 0.12, 0.12, 0.06, 0.55, 0.30, 0.30), nrow=4)
bsp <- sampleEntryNumbers(bsp, targetBudget=50000, percentRanges=percentRanges)

}
